Analysis of FCFS and Priority Scheduling Algorithms (also from gppttt)

Input:
Courses:
- CSC2201: 3 hours, priority 2, arrival time 1
- CSC3401: 2 hours, priority 3, arrival time 2
- CSC1103: 1 hour, priority 1, arrival time 3

FCFS Output:
Order: CSC2201 → CSC3401 → CSC1103
Average Waiting Time: 2.33
Average Turnaround Time: 4.33

Priority Scheduling Output:
Order: CSC2201 → CSC1103 → CSC3401
Average Waiting Time: 1
Average Turnaround Time: 3.67

Analysis:
FCFS is straightforward and schedules based on arrival time only. It doesn't consider course importance (priority), which can delay more critical courses.

Priority Scheduling improves performance by scheduling high-priority classes earlier, provided they've already arrived. This leads to better average waiting and turnaround times.

Conclusion:
Priority Scheduling is more suitable for class scheduling where course importance matters and arrival times are known.
