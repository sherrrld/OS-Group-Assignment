FCFS 

// Description of the Algorithm
The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm is the simplest scheduling algorithm, where the classes (or processes) are scheduled in the order they appear in the queue. It is a non-preemptive algorithm, meaning once a class is scheduled, it will run to completion without interruption.

In FCFS, all parameters like priority and arrival time are ignored. Scheduling is purely based on the original input order.

// Input Used
We used the following class input for simulation, in the form {course_code, duration, priority, arrival_time}:

  Process proc[] = {
    {2201, 3, 2, 1},  // CSC2201, 3 hours, priority 2, wants to start first
    {3401, 2, 3, 2},  // CSC3401, 2 hours, priority 3, wants to start second
    {1103, 1, 1, 3}   // CSC1103, 1 hour, priority 1, wants to start third
};

Note: FCFS ignores both the priority and the preferred start time (arrival time).

// Output from FCFS Algorithm
Based on the above input, the order of scheduling is:

  FCFS Scheduling Order:
  Course 2201 Course 3401 Course 1103

Waiting Times:
  Course 2201: 0
  Course 3401: 3
  Course 1103: 5

Turnaround Times:
  Course 2201: 3
  Course 3401: 5
  Course 1103: 6

Average Waiting Time:
(0+3+5)/3 = 2.67 hours

Average Turnaround Time:
(3+5+6)/3 = 4.67 hours
